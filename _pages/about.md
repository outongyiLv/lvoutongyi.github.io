I earned my Bachelor of Mathematics degree from Northeastern University (China) in 2022. I am currently pursuing a direct Ph.D. at the School of Mathematical Sciences and the Institute of Natural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research centers on Deep Learning, with a special emphasis on Deep Reinforcement Learning. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Machine Learning algorithms and theories.


Homepage
======
Welcome to my homepage! I have authored several blogs covering topics in Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Mathematics, which you can explore on my CSDN profile: [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/lvoutongyi?spm=1000.2115.3001.5343). For a comprehensive look at my academic contributions, please visit my Google Scholar profile here: [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=1ZFUKEIAAAAJ). 




Intern
======
1. Baidu (China): During my internship at Baidu (China) in the Knowledge Graph Department, I utilized Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune the ERNIE Model. Additionally, I addressed a large-scale path planning problem, the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), using multimodal training with Reinforcement Learning at Baidu.

2. Microsoft Research Asia: I am currently an intern at the AI4Science department of Microsoft Research Asia. My primary focus is on integrating Reinforcement Learning with large language models.
