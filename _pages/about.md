I got my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Northeastern University (China) in 2022. I am now a direct Ph.D. student at the School of Mathematical Sciences and the Institute of Natural Sciences of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  My research field mainly focuses on Deep Learning, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning. By the way, I am also interested in algorithms and theories in Machine Learning.


Homepage
======
I have written some blogs about Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning, you can find them on my CSDN page:
[CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/lvoutongyi?spm=1000.2115.3001.5343), I also have my own scholar, you can get my personal academic home page here: [Google](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=1ZFUKEIAAAAJ).


Intern
======
I have interned at Baidu (China) (Knowledge Graph Department) to combine Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune 
the ERNIE Model, I also did a large-scale path planning problem (CVRP) with multimodal training using RL in Baidu.
