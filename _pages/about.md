Educational experience
======
I got my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Northeastern University (China) in 2022. I am now a direct Ph.D. student at the School of Mathematical Sciences and the Institute of Natural Sciences of Shanghai Jiaotong University.  My research field mainly focuses on Deep Learning, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning. By the way, I am also interested in algorithms and theories in Machine Learning.

Homepage
======
I have written some blogs about Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning, you can find them on my CSDN page:
[CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/lvoutongyi?spm=1000.2115.3001.5343), you can get my personal academic home page here: [Google](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=1ZFUKEIAAAAJ).


I used to be an intern at Baidu (China)(Knowledge Graph Department). I Combine Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune 
the ERNIE Model. Also, I did a large-scale path planning problem (CVRP) in the RL direction in Baidu.

Awards
======
I have received some awards and honors:
1. The first prize in the Mathematical Modeling Contest in the Yangtze River Delta Region, 2022.
2. The second prize in the Shuwei Cup International Undergraduate Modeling Contest 2021.
3. The third prize in the National Big Data Competition for Chinese University 2021.
4. The Provincial second prize in the National Mathematical Modeling Contest 2021.
5. The Provincial third prize in the National Mathematical Modeling Contest 2020.
6. The third prize in the National Undergraduate Mathematics Contest 2019.
7. The Provincial second prize in the National Undergraduate Mathematics Contest 2019.
8. The Outstanding Graduates of Liaoning Province 2022.
